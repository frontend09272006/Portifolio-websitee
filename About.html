                                <p class="text-black-50 mt-5">My motivation for my applied research is to bridge the social and ecological divides we are currently facing at global and local levels. I aim to achieve this through the development of new concepts, methods and tools to capture complex and multi-dimensional phenomena (such as risk and vulnerability) through systems thinking and in a spatial-explicit manner. Ultimately, this aims to support decision makers and the society at large, to make better informed and aware decisions. Application domains include disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation, public health and the wider humanitarian domain.
